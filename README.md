# MLtutorials
Lab internal ML teaching tutorials & Markdown slides for Google Colab to get hands-on experience using PyTorch.  
Based on [Goodfellow et al. (2015) "Deep Learning"](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

### Pre-requisites
* Basic knowledge of Python - see [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-programming-introduction)
* Basics of Linear Algebra, and Probabilities / Statistics
* see also [Numpy for Matlab users](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html)
